# ThermalCamera_MLX90640
-----------------------
General Info
- 

MLX90640 Features:
- Detects: surface area temperatures
- Range: -40°C to 300°C
- WIDE Model: 110°x75° field of view
- Acuracy: 1.5°C
- Resolution: 32x24 px ()
- Voltage : 3 - 5V (internal 3 volts converter)
- Current consumption: ~18mA
- up to 64 FPS
- I2C interface

**Note:** 

The MLX90640 measures infrared temperature only; it cannot capture RGB images from visible light. Instead, it detects heat emitted by objects, which can then be converted into a coloured image.

Each pixel in the camera frame functions as an individual sensor point (an array of 32 × 24 = 768 pixels). Every pixel measures the temperature at its specific location, providing readings between −40 °C and 300 °C.*
